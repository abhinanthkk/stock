1.Problem Statement:

            Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project addresses that challenge by applying AI-driven forecasting models to historical stock data to generate accurate and interpretable predictions.

2.Objectives :

    Predict future stock prices using historical time series data

    Compare ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models

    Visualize model outputs and residuals

    Deliver insights through performance metrics and visualizations


3.Dataset :

    Source: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance), Alpha Vantage, Kaggle

    Type: Time-series data (OHLCV format)

    Target: Closing stock price


4.Technologies Used :

    Languages: Python

    Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, keras, prophet, yfinance

    Platform: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

    Deployment (optional): Streamlit


5.Project Workflow :

    1. Data Collection
    2. Data Preprocessing
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    4. Feature Engineering
    5. Model Building (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
    6. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, MAPE
    7. Result Visualization
    8. (Optional) Web App Deployment



6.Modeling Approaches :

    ARIMA: Statistical approach for linear time series forecasting
    Prophet: Handles trend and seasonality with flexibility
    LSTM: Deep learning model for capturing sequential dependencies


7.Results:

    Model performance is evaluated using
    RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error
    MAE: Mean Absolute Error
    MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
    Visualizations include actual vs predicted prices, residual plots, and moving averages.
